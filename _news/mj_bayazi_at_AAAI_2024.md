Thrilled to have been at the AAAI Conference, where we dived deep into discussions on Artificial Intelligence, Human Intelligence, their interaction, and Time Series. Presented our latest research on Artificial Neural Network and Brain Signal Analysis ([https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3951614/v1](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3951614/v1)). It was a fantastic opportunity to connect and exchange ideas with fellow enthusiasts! ðŸ§ ðŸ’¡
