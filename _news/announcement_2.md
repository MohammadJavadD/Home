Just completed the Generative AI with Large Language Models course by DeepLearning.AI & Amazon Web Services.

It was fantastic! It provided a comprehensive overview of the key steps in the LLM-based generative AI lifecycle, from data gathering to deployment. I'm excited to use the knowledge gained here in our future projects.

Highly recommended for anyone interested in LLMs and deploying them in real-world applications. Thank you Andrew Ng, Mike Chambers and Chris Fregly. This course allows me to build working prototypes.

Kudos to DeepLearning.AI & Amazon Web Services (AWS) for such a learning experience! ðŸŒŸ
